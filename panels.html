            <li>
              <b>Julie-Anne Turner</b>, an M.A. student in the Faculty of Education whose research focuses on the design and impact of maker-oriented professional learning for in-service teachers
            </li>
            <li> <b>Jean-Luc Ciocca</b>, an M.A. student in the Faculty of Education whose M.A. research explored the complexities of teachers' maker-based planning processes.


            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Jonathan Weber</b>, a PhD student in the Faculty of Education whose work focuses on pre-service teachers' emergent Maker identities.
            </li>


          </ul>
          <b>Content:</b><br />This bilingual (French-English) panel discussion will include talks by four researchers from the Faculty of Education who study a range of topics in the field of Making and Maker-based approaches to teaching and learning.  In particular, panelists will discuss what is currently understood about Making as a pedagogical approach for learning in K-12 schools; how teachers plan maker activities;  how in-service and pre-service teachers come to self-identify as Makers and why it is important to research teacher learning if systems of schooling are to mobilize Making as learning at scale. Each panelist will focus on the practical implications of their work for students and teachers in schools.
